# Karatsuba-Polynomial-Multiplication
Polynomial Multiplication using Karatsuba's Algorithm

This algorithm takes two arrays of type List<Long> that represent the coefficients of the two polynomials and returns the coefficients of the product of their multiplication as a List<Long>. 

Assumptions:
Multiplier and multiplicand arrays have the same n number.
